I really did not want to go to Cleveland.

The company I work for, they design audio and visual systems for themed entertainment attractions. So the reason I went to Cleveland was to learn how to be "warranty support" for a show we're installing at the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame.

Basically, whenever the show messes up, I get to deal with it.

I'm usually programming at this job. One day, my manager heard me talking on the phone to client for some programming issue, and thought "Hey, that Eric guy sure is polite on the phone, we should have him do support for all of our shows."






Oh the way there, to the show, Jenny picked me up. She had just eaten eight coconuts and three mangos, can you believe that? She's studying "medical coding" at PCC, I asked her what that was, she said "Oh it's like putting information into a computer and figuring out how much certain medical procedures cost". I didn't really understand that answer.

On the way back, Alfredo was my Lyft driver. He used to manage McDonalds franchises, but now he's in Los Angeles Lyfting full time. He has a friend in Nebraska, this friend wants Alfredo to move to Nebraska and manage a few of the McDonalds that he's opening up, Alfredo is on the fence about it all.

My company had a car service pick me up, Oliver was my driver. I live in Boyle Heights, so naturally Oliver asked me about the neighborhood. He said that when he was growing up, my area was very "hood". He told me that the city enacted an ordinace that prohibited gang members from handing out i n parks. Oliver told me that to build Dodger Stadium, the city had to displace 60 families. He also told me a way to get cheap tickets.

Zach woods was there,
