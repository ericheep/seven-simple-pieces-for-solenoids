Basically, whenever the show messes up, I get to deal with it.

I'm usually programming at this job. One day, my manager heard me talking on the phone to client for some programming issue, and thought "Hey, that Eric guy sure is polite on the phone, we should have him do support for all of our shows."

The company I work for, they design audio and visual systems for themed entertainment attractions. So the reason I went to Cleveland was to work on this show we're installing at the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame.

And so there I was, working nights while the museum was closed and show programming.

That's something I got to dive into, "show programming", it's like regular programming, but you use a proprietary software that has its own programming language, all living on this piece of hardware which is installed on site.

The reason we use it, is that it allows the system to be "frame accurate," which ensures that you can sync not only audio and video, but also lights, walls moving, projection mapping, doors opening and closing, pretty much whatever.

Oh the way there, to the show, Jenny picked me up. She had just eaten eight coconuts and three mangos, can you believe that? She's studying "medical coding" at PCC, I asked her what that was, she said "Oh it's like putting information into a computer and figuring out how much certain medical procedures cost". I didn't really understand that answer.

On the way back, Alfredo was my Lyft driver. He used to manage McDonalds franchises, but now he's in Los Angeles Lyfting full time. He has a friend in Nebraska, this friend wants Alfredo to move to Nebraska and manage a few of the McDonalds that he's opening up, Alfredo is on the fence about it all.

My company had a car service pick me up, Oliver was my driver. I live in Boyle Heights, so naturally Oliver asked me about the neighborhood. He said that when he was growing up, my area was very "hood". He told me that the city enacted an ordinace that prohibited gang members from handing out i n parks. Oliver told me that to build Dodger Stadium, the city had to displace 60 families. He also told me a way to get cheap tickets.

Zach woods was there,


Hello. I'll be doing a set of short pieces, the whole of which I'm calling "Seven Simple Pieces for Solenoids."

This first one is called "Electrocmagnetic Fields."

~ play 1

So these solenoids here, they are actually large electromagnets that rotate a pin when sent enough voltage.

If you send them 24 volts for a long enough time, they actuate and make a large "thud."

During that last piece, I was sending them 24 volts, but I would never let them fully actuate.

They would partially actuate, retract, and then I would continue that very quickly.

What you were hearing were the electromagnetic fields that the solenoids were creating.

I know this isn't science class, but after the week I just had, I'm keen on dispelling the magic.

This next one is called "Shake."

This next one is called "Cable Retraction."
